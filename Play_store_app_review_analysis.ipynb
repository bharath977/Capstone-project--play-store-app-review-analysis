It serves an as platform to allow users with 'Google certified' Android operating system devices to donwload applications developed and published on the platform either with a charge or free of cost. With the rapidly growth of Android devices and apps, it would be interesting to perform data analysis on the data to obtain valuable insights.\n",

We focused on to answer the questions like, what makes an app popular, what should be the price and size of the app. In our data set we have two csv files for data analysis: Play Store data User Reviews At first, we analysis the play store data and in the play store data we have 10841 rows and 13 columns & in the user review data we have 64295 rows and 5 columns of data. We have to take the maximum outcomes from the data which help us to analysis the which type of app is most preferable and comparisons between different insights. Our goal is to filter and make plots accordingly for a better EDA with respect to the final data.\n",
